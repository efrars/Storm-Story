Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the most challenging moments that I had developing the app was learning about auto layout and constraints. It took me a lot of time just to do organize the layout. Following the Dino Lab I was able to understand some of it but I had to find other sources, it is kind of confusing. 
Another challenge that I was encoutering is that X-code was crashing everytime I will try to fix a constraint. Besides that, I am happy that I was able to complete the requirements.
